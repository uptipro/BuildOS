### Phase 4: End-to-End Workflow (`e2e.workflow.spec.ts`)

**Critical Workflows Tested:**
1. **Complete Payroll Processing Workflow**
   - User authentication
   - Payroll period creation
   - Employee data retrieval
   - Payroll validation
   - Payroll processing
   - Summary generation
   - Payslip generation

2. **Leave Request Workflow**
   - Leave request submission
   - Manager approval/rejection

3. **Approval Workflow**
   - Workflow instance creation
   - Pending approvals retrieval

4. **Notification System**
   - Notification retrieval
   - Marking notifications as read
   - Preference management

## Test Data Factory

The `TestDataFactory` class provides helper methods to create test data:

```typescript
// Create test employee
const employee = TestDataFactory.createEmployee({ baseSalary: 500000 });

// Create test leave request
const leave = TestDataFactory.createLeaveRequest(employeeId);

// Create test workflow instance
const workflow = TestDataFactory.createWorkflowInstance();
```

## Test Assertions

The `TestAssertions` class provides reusable assertion helpers:

```typescript
TestAssertions.assertPayslip(payslip);
TestAssertions.assertLeaveRequest(request);
TestAssertions.assertWorkflowInstance(instance);
TestAssertions.assertNotification(notification);
```

## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.json`)
- **testEnvironment**: node
- **transform**: ts-jest (TypeScript support)
- **moduleNameMapper**: Path alias support
- **collectCoverageFrom**: Collect coverage from src/**
- **setupFilesAfterEnv**: Run setup.ts before tests

### Test Environment Setup (`test/setup.ts`)
- Sets NODE_ENV to 'test'
- Configures test database URL
- Sets Jest timeout to 30 seconds for integration tests

## Coverage Goals

Target coverage metrics:
- **Statements**: > 80%
- **Branches**: > 75%
- **Functions**: > 80%
- **Lines**: > 80%

Run coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:cov
```

Coverage reports are generated in `coverage/` directory.

## Mock Data

Mock users available in `test.utils.ts`:
- **admin**: Full permissions
- **hrManager**: HR-specific permissions
- **projectManager**: Project management permissions
- **employee**: Basic employee permissions

## Continuous Integration

To integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test
  
- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage/lcov.info
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure test database is running
- Check DATABASE_URL in test/setup.ts
- Verify Prisma migrations are applied

### Timeout Issues
- Increase Jest timeout in test/setup.ts
- Check for unresolved promises in tests
- Verify async/await usage

### Module Not Found
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Clear node_modules and reinstall if needed
- Check module imports and aliases

## Performance Notes

- Integration tests take ~5-10 seconds
- E2E tests take ~15-20 seconds
- Use `--maxWorkers=1` for sequential execution if needed
- Parallel execution is enabled by default

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking
- [ ] Add load testing for payroll processing
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing for complex objects
- [ ] Add property-based testing with fast-check
- [ ] Implement mutation testing for code quality

## Contact & Support
